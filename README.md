# Downloading the paper

To download the sources for the paper use the following command:
```
git clone https://username@github.com/d-meiser/crossover
```
where `username` is your github user name.


# Making changes

Once you made some changes you can send them back to github using the
following commands:
```
git commit -a
git push
```
After entering `git commit -a` you'll be prompted for a commit message
which describes the changes.  Make sure to only check in sources, no
`aux` files, `log` files, etc.  Don't check in the CrossoverPaper.pdf
file.  The `git push` command will most likely require your github
password.
